# What is Hermes?
Hermes is a mobile web app designed to load voter info from a spreadsheet. It simplifies the process of looking up addresses on traditional paper sheets and allows for far easier texting and directions lookup.

# How do I get started?
To get started you will need to export your spreadsheet as a .csv file. Loading a .csv file on mobile is not the easiest. A better method is coming soon™. 

- Make your spreadsheet has the proper headers:
`First`
`Name`
`Last Name`
`Cell`
`Address`
`City`
`Zip5`
If the following are not headers in your spreadsheet, the app will be unable to load the data. 
- On a computer, export from Google Sheets go File > Download as > Comma-separated Values (.CSV).
- You will need to download the .CSV file onto your computer or phone. Load a .csv file by using the “Choose File” button, then click “Load”
# Using the app
Hermes is composed of four files. It is a web app built using HTML and Javascript.
- You can use to app on a phone or computer at: https://djrubio2.github.io/hermes/. On iOS you can add the webpage to your homescreen where it should function like an installed app.
- You can download the files necessary to run Hermes off your own webserver if you wish.
